# The American Breakfast
Perhaps the single most satisfying thing in a man’s life is the feeling that he’s able to provide nourishment to his tribe. There are many versions of the American breakfast, mine is simple but requires skills and tools that you will need hone over time. Additional, theses skills and tools can be used on Sunday night meals as well as four day camping trips. I provide these lessons as a guide and I hope that you hone your craft and pass the lessons you learn to someone in your tribe.

## BBQ
Wait! How in God’s green earth are you going to start a lesson about breakfast with BBQ, is this an excuse to drink? No, and yes. Every man should own a BBQ. Some men choose a stainless steel shinny gas grill. It will dull and rust over time, just as you will neglect it. Propane is too easy. Turn the knob, drop a match and boom 400 degrees. The art and craft of grilling and cooking over fire requires you to learn how to start a fire and respect the effort and time it takes to build and maintain heat. You will fail many times over and over, but once you learn. You’ll be able to start a fire on a wet a cold night when a camping trip goes from fun to shit. So

I recommend you by an old fashion 22 inch Classic Weber. This no frills grill uses charcoal for heat. You’ll need to collect the ashes and learn how to place the coals to achieve the right temp and flame for the meal at hand. You might be tempted to buy lighter fluid, but I urge you to use kindling and challenge you start the fire with a single match. To complement your grill buy a chimney. It’s the only way to get all coals lit at the same time. Buy a pair of metal tongs to adjust to coals too, it’s also a good time to buy a metal pail for the ashes.

So what does the BBQ have to do with the breakfast, hang with me for a minute. See you need to grill to an important thing. Season your cast iron skillet.

## Cast Iron
This is feeling more like a shopping list from hell than an recipe for breakfast. There is nothing better than a solid cast iron pan. Again there’s expensive ones that are nice and enameled. But never use those on the grill, I have made that expensive mistake. You can pick up a Lodge 10inch skillet for few bucks.

You’ll need to start a fire and while the coals are getting white, you’ll need to rub a high temp oil on your clean skillet. When you get a good coat on it and the coals are hot, place the coals in a pile and place the grate over the coals and the skillet upside down over the coals.

Now you drink, play cards do what you do. But do not move or touch that skillet!!!! Leave it alone for 2 to 3 hours.

Hopefully you did this on a Friday night, and your planning on breakfast for Saturday.

## Grocery List

**The protein**
 The Beeler’s are sponsored by the Pork industry (google Beeler Pork) so I always buy ground sausage in the 1lbs tube. You can use any meat or meat like substance, but it needs to have some fat content. You can substitute the fat with shorting.

** The Gravy - **
- Milk - whole milk, 2 cups
- Butter - 1.5 Tsbp
- 1/3 cup all purpose flour
- Pepper

Brown your sausage in the skillet over medium heat (think 4); set the protein to the side.

Lower the heat a smidge (3) and add the butter and once it’s starts to brown then add the flour and milk.

Whisk until the gravy thickens at which point you add the pepper, continue to whisk until the simmer bubbles show up, then you add the protein back.

Serve the gravy over the open biscuit

** The Biscuits - **
- 2 cups Self-Rising Flour (227 g)
- 1/4 cup cold butter grated (57 g)
- 2/3 to 3/4 cup cold milk or buttermilk (152-170 g)

__Notes:__

I like to weigh all of my ingredients because flour can be a little tricky to measure appropriately due to the way it packs. Adding too much flour will make these biscuits dry and chewy. The weight is in parentheses in case you have a kitchen scale. If you don't weigh your ingredients then I highly suggest looking up how to measure flour correctly...it will change the way everything you bake tastes!

Flour has to be self-rising, otherwise the biscuits won't rise.

Grate your butter. It will make the whole process easier. I like to grate the night before and then cover the butter and place it in the freezer. I have also grated the day of and there really isn't a difference. Grating the butter will make working the butter in a lot easier (you won't need a pastry knife and you literally just need to stir the butter in). I also use unsalted butter and have never tried using salted butter. By the way your don't have to grate your butter, you can cut it into pats, but then you will need to use a pastry knife to work the butter into the flour.

Last but not least, don't over knead and roll these biscuits. Once you turn it out on the floured surface, sprinkle it with flour and roll. Don't roll and fold more than six times otherwise your biscuits will not rise well. The don't have to be perfect and once they are cut and baked you won't even notice. If there are any scraps after I cut my biscuits then I smush together and make very imperfect biscuits. It isn't worth rolling the dough again because they won't rise as nicely. I like to use all my dough because the biscuits are delicious and they go quick in my house, you can also just throw away the scraps.

## DE-structions (biscuits):

**Preheat the oven to 425°**

- Place the flour in a bowl. Work in the butter or shortening just until crumbs are the size of large peas.
- Add 2/3 cup of the milk or buttermilk, and stir until the mixture holds together and leaves the sides of the bowl, adding more milk or buttermilk if needed (usually not necessary).
- Scoop the dough onto a well-floured surface, and fold it over on itself several times, using more flour as needed to prevent sticking.
- Roll or pat the dough into a 5" x 8 1/2" rectangle about 1/2" to 3/4" thick.
- Cut biscuits with a sharp, round 2" cutter, dipping the cutter into flour between cuts to reduce sticking. Or cut the rectangle into 12 small rectangular biscuits, which will allow you to skip the step of re-rolling and cutting scraps.
- If you've used a round cutter, pat the scraps together, and cut additional biscuits.
- Place the biscuits on an un-greased baking sheet, leaving about 1" between them for crisp biscuits. Arrange biscuits so they're barely touching for soft-side biscuits. For higher-rising soft-side biscuits, place biscuits in an 8" round pan.
- Bake the biscuits for 10 to 14 minutes, or until they're a light golden brown.
- Remove them from the oven, and serve hot. Cool leftovers completely, wrap airtight, and store at room temperature for several days; freeze for longer storage. To refresh room-temperature biscuits, place on a baking sheet, tent lightly with foil, and bake in a preheated 350°F oven for 10 to 13 minutes, until heated through. Toasting them also works for a quick breakfast!

Yield: about 1 dozen 2" biscuits.
