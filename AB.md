# The American Breakfast
I have found one of the most satisfying things in life is the ability to provide nourishment to my tribe. There are many versions of the American breakfast, mine is a simple recipe, but requires time and taste before you can hone the craft to perfection. Additional, the knowledge, skills, and mastery of the primitive tools in this guide can be used for elegant Sunday night meals or four-day rough camping trips. I provide this guide without a warranty and hope that you pass the lessons you learn to someone in your tribe.

## Start the BBQ
Wait! How in God's green earth are you going to start a lesson about breakfast with the BBQ, is this an excuse to drink? No, and yes. Every human should own a BBQ. Some choose a stainless steel shiny gas grill. It will dull and rust over time, just as you will neglect it. Propane is too easy. Turn the knob, drop a match, and boom 400 degrees. The art and craft of cooking over fire require the ability to not only start a fire but to respect the effort and time it takes to build and maintain warmth it provides. You will fail this lesson many times, but once you learn. You'll be able to start a fire on a wet a cold night when a camping trip goes from fun to shit. There are better experts than I on this topic, but remember there are three things you need to get a fire going. They are air, ignition, and fuel. Without the right mixture of each, you'll be serving cold raw burgers. It took me a long time to realize that a match is a tiny campfire, and if I want it to grow into an "eight-foot holy shit, the roof is going to catch fire monster." Then I recommend you add the elements incrementally to increasing the scale only slightly slower than that punk who races up and down the street at 6pm.

I recommend you by an old fashion 22-inch Classic Weber as your fire vessel. This no-frills grill uses charcoal for fuel. You'll need to collect the ashes and learn how to place the coals to achieve the right temp and flame for the meal at hand. You might be tempted to buy lighter fluid, but I urge you to use kindling and challenge you start the fire with a single match. To complement your efforts, buy a chimney. It's the only way to get all coals lit at the same time. Buy a pair of metal tongs to adjust to coals too, it's also an excellent time to buy a metal pail for the ashes. Oh, and an ov'glove.

So what does the BBQ have to do with breakfast? See, you will need to grill to an important thing. Your cast iron skillet!

## Cast Iron Skillet
Are you getting the feeling that this more like a shopping list from hell than a recipe for breakfast? Perhaps. Then again, there is nothing more versatile than a solid cast iron pan. There are expensive ones that are nice and enameled. But never use those on the grill, I have made that costly mistake. You can pick up a Lodge 10inch skillet for few bucks. If you somehow ruin it, you can simply replace it.

You'll need to start a fire, and while the coals are getting white, you'll need to massage a high temp oil on your clean skillet. Once you've applied a good coat on it, and the coals are hot, place on the grate upside down.

Now you drink, play cards do what you do. But do not move or touch that skillet!!!! Leave it alone for 2 to 3 hours.

Hopefully, you started this on a Friday night, and your planning on breakfast for Saturday.

## Grocery List

#### The Protein
I buy ground sausage in the 1lbs tube. You can use any meat or meat-like substance, but it needs to have some fat content. You can substitute the fat with shorting.

#### The Gravy
- Milk - whole milk, 2 cups
- Butter - 1.5 Tbsp
- 1/3 cup all-purpose flour
- Pepper

#### The Biscuits
- 2 cups Self-Rising Flour (227 g)
- 1/4 cup cold butter grated (57 g)
- 2/3 to 3/4 cup cold milk or buttermilk (152-170 g)

_Notes:_

_I like to weigh all of my ingredients because flour can be a little tricky to measure appropriately due to the way it packs. Adding too much flour will make these biscuits dry and chewy. The weight is in parentheses in case you have a kitchen scale. If you don't weigh your ingredients then I highly suggest looking up how to measure flour correctly...it will change the way everything you bake tastes!_

_Flour has to be self-rising, otherwise, the biscuits won't rise._

_Grate your butter. It will make the whole process easier. I like to grate the night before and then cover the butter and place it in the freezer. I have also grated the day of and there really isn't a difference. Grating the butter will make working the butter in a lot easier (you won't need a pastry knife and you literally just need to stir the butter in). I also use unsalted butter and have never tried using salted butter. By the way, you don't have to grate your butter, you can cut it into pats, but then you will need to use a pastry knife to work the butter into the flour._

_Last but not least, don't over knead and roll these biscuits. Once you turn it out on the floured surface, sprinkle it with flour and roll. Don't roll and fold more than six times; otherwise, your biscuits will not rise well. The don't have to be perfect and once they are cut and baked you won't even notice. If there are any scraps after I cut my biscuits, then I smash together and make very imperfect biscuits. It isn't worth rolling the dough again because they won't rise as nicely. I like to use all my dough because the biscuits are delicious and they go quick in my house, you can also just throw away the scraps._

## DE-structions (biscuits):
_**Yield: about 1 dozen 2" biscuits.**_

* Preheat the oven to 425°

- Brown your sausage in the skillet over medium heat (~ 40%); and set the side.

- Lower the heat a smidge (3) and add the butter and once it's starting to brown then add the flour. With a flat whisk move the mixture around until it gets like a yellow butter cake, then add the milk.


- Whisk until the gravy thickens at which point you add the pepper, continue to whisk until the simmer bubbles show up, then you add the protein back.Place on low heat and stir occasionally/

- Place the flour in a bowl. Work in the butter or shortening just until crumbs are the size of large peas.

- Add 2/3 cup of the milk or buttermilk, and stir until the mixture holds together and leaves the sides of the bowl, adding more milk or buttermilk if needed (usually not necessary).

- Scoop the dough onto a well-floured surface, and fold it over on itself several times, using more flour as required to prevent sticking.

- Roll or pat the dough into a 5" x 8 1/2" rectangle about 1/2" to 3/4" thick.

- Cut biscuits with a sharp, round 2" cutter, dipping the cutter into flour between cuts to reduce sticking. Or cut the rectangle into 12 small rectangular biscuits, which will allow you to skip the step of re-rolling and cutting scraps.

- If you've used a round cutter, pat the scraps together, and cut additional biscuits.

- Place the biscuits on an ungreased baking sheet, leaving about 1" between them for crisp biscuits. Arrange biscuits so they're barely touching for soft-sided biscuits. For higher-rising soft-side biscuits, place biscuits in an 8" round pan.

- Bake the biscuits for 10 to 14 minutes, or until they're a light golden brown.

- Remove them from the oven, and serve hot. For leftovers completely, wrap airtight, and store at room temperature for several days; freeze for longer storage. To refresh room-temperature biscuits, place on a baking sheet, tent lightly with foil, and bake in a preheated 350°F oven for 10 to 13 minutes, until heated through. Toasting them also works for a quick breakfast!

- Serve the gravy over the open biscuit.
