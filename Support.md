# Introduction and why does this exist 

When talking to leaders in different support organizations, different questions come up, but they are all fundamentally rooted with the same desired outcome. _"How do I provide the best experience for my customer(s)"._

Over the past two decades, I have been afforded the opportunity to dive deep into the support discipline. This document contains my beliefs on the topic and is the combination of my experiences, knowledge, and education. To promote a growth mindset, I would like to challenge my thoughts and principals by widening the audience and seeking feedback to improve or alter my beliefs. Additionally, I believe that this document may aid new leaders in tackling support for the first time. 


## How I got here

I have always been fascinated with the realm of mechanical engineering, and the modern four-stroke engine is one example of a calibrated orchestra of multiple moving components delivering a force that can be experienced by all five senses (if you ever get the chance to experience drag cars in person do it!). My passion for automobiles grew into my teens; unfortunately, my love for good grades did not follow. When I turned 19, I was a fully trained diesel mechanic. Having the knowledge of how to tune a Cummins 8.3l engine, I thought I was going to rule the world. But as it turns out, I spent the first year of my diesel mechanic career doing mundane tasks like upgrading CB's to helping drivers configure their Bluetooth headsets. Once I was stuck with polishing 28 feet of stainless steel on a trailer for a food show. Yeah, it turns out that I wasn't going to get much time wrenching. Instead, I made my mark talking to customers, learning what they wanted. Over time I made my way into (near) luxury automobiles. It was a lot of the same in some degree, people wanted to sync their phonebooks to their new cars, program their garage door openers, gain a better understanding of the noise they heard when they missed a gear at 70mph.  

Technology hasn't always fallen short on its promise to deliver a future of ease and convenience. But often times I have wondered if engineers and product teams have lost focus on the why.

Professionally I made the transition from cars to technology after my experience with Apple products. Spurred from curiosity after reading "The Second Coming of Steve Jobs, Alan Deutschman,” I purchased my first Mac and fell in love and made a commitment that I would work for Apple. Making that awkward leap took some tricky navigating, especially with the hiring managers. I convinced them that I was able to apply my automotive soft skills while becoming proficient and technology savvy. On Nov 11, 2004, I was given a badge and privilege to become employee 69729 and started my professional technical support career.

I was able to transfer my passion for helping people understand their technology in their cars to the technology in their computers, phones, and various other digital devices. It was rewarding and fulfilling to empower and help someone demystify something that was supposed to make their life easier. Translating technology into enabling solutions became my purpose and passion.
    
Along with my journey, I have found the most successful support folks, share some variation of this passion and purpose. They all get excited at the opportunity to make someone else’s life better. 

## The Culture of _Support_...
I define culture as:

_A set of assumed truths that a team has adopted to solve it's problems (both internally and externally), these adoptions are shared with new members_

When I join a team, I take the time to inspect and learn the culture. Although I am tempted to challenge the assumed truths them at face value, I try not to unless I can guarantee immediate failure. After I have gained an understanding of the current status quo, I start to challenge the foundations of the culture. I use statements like _" help me understand why..._, and _what's the desired outcome for..._. I am not always successful, and that's OK. There are times when you need to adopt the truths. 

Through inspection, I learn each members journey I probe to learn their traits, and talents. Discover where they are skilled and knowledgeable. This allows me to cast them into the ideal support or leadership persona. Do I get it right everytime? Nope, not even 50% of the time do I get it right, typically I get close and then allow experiences to speak for the other 50%. 

Once I have a basic understanding of the culture on the team, I assert my culture prioritization mantra **Team, Teammate, Self**. I ask them to focus on the mission of the team, then find ways to help their teammate, lastly concentrate on making themselves the best version of themselves, so they are a better teammate and part of a stronger team. 

I also use this time to re-engage with team members at the personal level and remind them of the reason we exist. This helps me ensure we have the right people in the proper roles. Sometimes I discover someone who’s been incorrectly cast onto a team. These individuals have a hard time reengaging the same topic over and over (like password schema) with the same excitement. They don’t share the same hope of possibly getting a ticket queue to zero (a unicorn in the support domain). They don’t carry the same vigor when a new instance of the same old problem shows its ugly head.

If someone has the technical aptitude, we can teach them the logic of the most complex systems. If they are persistent, we can show them the library of technical articles to find deeply hidden solutions. If they show a grin when the shit hits the fan, then we can supply them with all the caffeine and pizza. Combine all three of natural talents, and you have the perfect person for support.

## Give a Northstar

Every team needs to have a Mission Statement, you  **cannot** afford to operate with one. This ensures that everyone knows the Northstar. Start simple, less is more. Ensure it's not too ambiguous but defines a future desired outcome. Lastly, the mission statement should be generational. 

Currently, I am working with the following statement:

**PROVIDE A WORLD CLASS TRAINING & SUPPORT EXPERIENCE THAT COMPLIMENTS OUR PRODUCTS AND EMPOWERS OUR TEAMMATES.**

Every quarter we build objectives and strategies to achieve a degree closer to the mission statement. I like to categorize them into the **Team, Teammate, and Self** priorities. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. 

## Prioritize the Work
When I worked in support operations, I learned (the hard way) I had to focus on myself and my work. I was heavily influenced by Gene Kim's “The Phoenix Project.” In his book, he talks about three parallels. I have summarized them as they pertain to support:

1. Increase your velocity downstream
2. Increase feedback upstream
3. Continually focus on improving

These parallels need to remain in focus when thinking about project work. But there are other types of work and a priority in which you need to execute them:

1. **Fires** - you have to deal with these first. De-escalate any and all fires
2. **Techincal Debt** - you have to pay tech debt down to prevent fires. Else the fires just keep coming. This relates to parallel 3 above.
3. **Project work** - this the value you bring to the organization. This is parallel 1 & 2

I tell leaders to think about an actual fire, you have to put that out before you improve or put measures in place to prevent it from happening again. Once you're safe, you can focus on the wallpaper. 

## Support the Business
The section above has served me well with technical teams and operations, but with support, there is another order of operations that you need to be aware of.

1. Accurate - you have to be right 
2. Available - you have to there
3. Partner - build a partnership with your stakeholders
4. Advisor - teach and influence the future decisions of stakeholders

For my team we have two primary roles that split these operations up into primary areas of responsibilities:

### The Response Specialist -
This role focuses on being accurate and available. We build schedules to match our demand and focus on metrics like "first-time reply" and SLA’s. Like an ATM, if you ask for a $20 and get a $5, it doesn't matter how many machines there are you won't trust any of them. Burn these two areas and **Go Right To Jail, Do Not Pass Go, Do Not Collect $200.** It's been my experience that when support teams go astray, it's because they have failed to focus on these two concepts of support first and foremost. As simple as it sounds these areas are critical and fundamentally the most important. 

### The Product Specialist -
This role is less transactional and more transformational. Focused on building partnerships and becoming an advisor for stakeholders. They need to coach and support the response specialist, understand the expectations of the end-user, and explain the constraints of the product team. We rely on various satisfaction scores to measure the engagement of the product specialist. We challenge them with creating documentation that encourages self-help and decreases the dependency on the response. We have them deliver engaging training sessions that invoke user feedback. We measure success when the product specialist is considered the expert advisor in a domain. 

While the Product Support Specialist is the proactive approach to support, we could not achieve it without the reactive foundation of the response specialist. When this symbiotic relationship is made, we are able to:
1. Deliver accurate responses to our customers, immediately becoming hypersensitive to their needs before our own
2. Become a trusted advisor to help the organization deliver on its promise to bring the obligation to provide a future of ease and convenience to reality.
