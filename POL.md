# Pillars of Leadership

* __Strategic Agility__ - see and implement vision</li>
* __Perspective__ - integrate structures and staff</li>
* __Operational Effectiveness__ - balance systems and organization style

These are the three pillars for leadership. Without them you cannot be an effective leader. Each complements the other.

Strategic agility guides your decisions and ensures that you act with intention and purpose. If you cannot create a vision for your team or feel comfortable with leveraging strong partnerships to create one, you cannot create a plan to act upon.

Perspective frames that vision. If you are caught up in the details your frame is to narrow and you can easily overlook opportunities and upcoming obstacles. If you cannot tacitly determine how maneuver out of the manusha then your perspective is too wide. You need to be able to manage at both the macro and micro level, keep them in balance so that you can anticipate the next move while guiding your team to execution.

Operational Effectiveness, is the ability to know who and how to get things completed in the organization both formally and informally. Your vision must be in alignment to the overall function of the organization, else you and your team will be targeted as radical and others will resist your vision of change.  

In order to create change, you need to first understand the culture of the team.  

__Culture__: a pattern of shared assumptions that a group has learned as it has solved it’s problems of external adaptation and internal integration, that has been effective enough to be considered valid enough to be taught to new members as the accepted way to think and act in relation to those problems. 

Understanding why certain solutions are assumed truths will help you develop a perspective on how the team is tackling problems. It’s easy to get stuck here, because as leaders we obsess over the details. Without that obsession false solutions become the accepted truth. You’ll need to judge what things are flat wrong verses good enough. If you can widen your perspective you might find a common solution for multiple concerns increasing your chances of success while decreasing your efforts.

Leadership is about providing direction through common buy-in. That common buy-in becomes a collective group otherwise known as your team. Not everyone is a team player. Some people prefer to go it alone. Don’t try to convert them, the cost is generally to high and often leads to failure. If you are fair and firm you can set the course to be advantageous to the whole and the individual while maintaining an exit strategy for both parties.

Set your vision as a mission, measure success against that vision. If you cannot measure it, you cannot manage it. Every action is ether a compliment or an insult. For support I measure success under four categories:

* Proactive Efficiency - # Session delivered v. offered
* Reactive Efficiency - TAT, FCT, Volume Closed v. Opened
* Operational Readiness - Utilization at 90%
* Happiness - CSAT, Employee Happiness Score

Standards are the price of admission not a badge of honor. Employees don’t raise to the occasion they fall to the level of the standard. Set the standard and hold others accountable to it.

Iron sharpens iron, if employees don’t feel comfortable in holding each other accountable then there is no trust. In order to grow we must be challenged, but if we are not honest and we hide personal agendas then we cannot have honest conflicts about our deficiencies. You are responsible for guiding the team to success, not for guiding an bunch of individuals on their personal life journeys.

Leadership is obligated to detect external change and develop a strategy to react to that change
These changes should be viewed as an opportunity for growth or advancement
Leadership should carefully take intentional actions that result in moving more than one step forward.
Leadership should make non-emotional objective approaches to an solution
Each leader should know the pieces of the whole for each discipline on our team, so that they may make knowledgeable decisions.
